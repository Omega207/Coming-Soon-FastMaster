This is about what I'm working on and the newest repositories! 
| 5/4/2022: Coming soon! There will be a branch of my Hello World repo for a mobile edition!
(You may have to have Visual Studio 2022 to use the project.) You may modify the code and release
it as a branch of its repository. (When it comes out, of course.) The test project is expected to release by May 10th, 2022.
Check back later!
